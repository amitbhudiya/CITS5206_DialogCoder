## Project Overview

**DialogCoder** (aka *PulsarBurp*) is a streamlined offline application designed to automate the qualitative coding of dialogue transcripts, particularly in research settings involving high-volume team interactions such as submarine simulator exercises. The tool eliminates repetitive manual work by tagging transcript rows based on a user-defined dictionary ‚Äî or optionally, using LLM-enhanced classification.

This project includes two distinct pipelines:

- **Plan A (MVP):** A production-ready pipeline that uses rule-based keyword matching to code transcript data. Plan A was delivered as the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** and is fully functional for secure, offline use.
- **Plan B (POC):** A **proof-of-concept** pipeline that integrates Large Language Model (LLM) predictions via OpenRouter to enhance classification accuracy. Plan B is experimental and not part of the MVP.

## Project Scope

This project includes:

- Development of a user-friendly multi-page Streamlit web interface for Plan A.
- Implementation of a standalone demo UI for Plan B (LLM-enhanced).
- Support for automated coding of transcript CSV files using a predefined dictionary.
- Capability to process multiple files in batch.
- Generation of frequency reports summarizing code usage.
- Complete offline operation (Plan A) to safeguard sensitive data.
- CI/CD workflows for both pipelines using GitHub Actions.
- A comprehensive test suite including unit and end-to-end tests.

> ‚úÖ **Note:** Only **Plan A** is part of the MVP and intended for production use. **Plan B** is a standalone **proof-of-concept** to explore LLM integration in this context.

## Features

- üîç **Automated Transcript Coding (Plan A)**  
  Apply a user-defined keyword dictionary to assign communication codes to dialogue rows in CSV transcript files.

- üìÇ **Bulk File Processing**  
  Upload and process multiple transcripts simultaneously, dramatically reducing manual workload.

- üìä **Frequency Summary Report**  
  Automatically generate summaries showing how often each communication code appears across transcripts.

- üß± **Modular Architecture**  
  Clean separation between keyword matching, UI logic, LLM dispatching, and persistence.

- üîê **Offline Operation (Plan A)**  
  Designed for secure environments ‚Äî no internet connection is required to use the core MVP.

  - üß† **LLM-Augmented Classification (Plan B, optional)**  
  Use OpenRouter to classify dialogue lines when keyword matches are insufficient or ambiguous *(experimental)*.

- üß™ **Robust Testing**  
  Unit tests, end-to-end tests, and isolated test suites for Plan A and Plan B pipelines.

- üîÑ **Continuous Integration**  
  GitHub Actions automate testing, linting, and CI checks for both pipelines with separate workflows.

# Plan A - Keyword Matching (MVP)

## Getting Started with Plan A - MVP

Plan A is the **original, production-ready implementation** that uses a classic keyword matching approach to automate dialogue transcript coding. It provides a streamlined multi-page interface built with Streamlit and includes core components for transcript processing, coding dictionary management, and report generation, all contained within the `app/` directory.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation / Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CITS5206_DialogCoder.git
   cd CITS5206_DialogCoder
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

You can run the application in two ways:

#### Option 1: Using the Launcher (Windows)
We provide a launcher executable to simplify the application startup process.

**File Structure:**
Make sure you have the following file structure:
```
DialogCoder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DialogCoder.exe    # Application launcher
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/               # Application files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Home.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/              # Source files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt  # Dependencies list
```

**Usage:**
1. Make sure you have installed all prerequisites (Python and dependencies)
2. Double-click `DialogCoder.exe` to launch the application
3. A command prompt window will open first, followed by your default web browser
4. The application will be available at http://localhost:8501
5. To close the application, simply close the command prompt window

**Note:** 
- The executable is just a launcher that simplifies starting the application
- The executable must be kept in the same directory as the `app` and `src` folders
- Do not move or delete any files in the `app` or `src` directories

#### Option 2: Using Command Line
Start the Streamlit application directly:

```bash
streamlit run app/Home.py   # ‚Üê classic Plan A UI
```
Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).

### In-App Guidance

**Each page of the application includes built-in instructions that clearly explain how to use its specific features**. These contextual guides walk you through uploading transcripts, selecting dictionaries, generating reports, and more‚Äîensuring a smooth user experience without needing to refer back to external documentation. *For a specific workflow, please take a look at the next section: Using the Application (GUI)*

# Plan B - LLM-assisted pipeline (POC)

## Getting Started with Plan B - LLM POC

Plan B is an experimental, self-contained pipeline that augments the classic
keyword matcher with an LLM (via **OpenRouter**) and a small set of additional
components written under `planb/`.

>‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Plan B is a proof of concept and not part of the production-ready MVP. It is provided as an experimental extension for further exploration.

### Installation / Setup

1. **Install Plan B specfic requirements**

   ```bash
   pip install -r planb/requirements-planb.txt
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file** in the repo root with your API key (and optional threshold override):

   ```env
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-..."
   CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.50  # default is 0.50 if omitted
   ```

### Running the Streamlit App

Start the Streamlit application:

 ```bash
   streamlit run planb/ui/app.py #Plan B - UI
   ```
Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).


## Using the Application (GUI)

Following is the instrcutions on how to navigate and use the program using the Graphical User Interface:

#### 1. Upload Your Files:
- Click "Upload transcript CSV or Excel file" on the left side
- Click "Upload dictionary CSV or Excel file" on the right side
- Success messages will confirm when files are loaded

#### 2. Configure Confidence Settings: 
- Use the "Confidence Threshold" slider to adjust how strict the matching should be:
   - Higher values (closer to 1.0): Only high-confidence matches
   - Lower values (closer to 0.0): More inclusive matching
   - Default (0.5): Balanced approach

#### 3. Run the Classification:
- Click the blue "Run Classification" button
- Wait while the system processes your files

#### 4. Review and Save Results:

- Review the color-coded results:
  - Green: High confidence matches (0.8+)
  - Yellow: Medium confidence matches (0.5-0.8)
  - Red: Low confidence matches (below 0.5)
  
- Click "Download Results CSV" to save the classified data

### Testing

The Plan B pipeline includes its own isolated test suite to ensure modular integrity and correct LLM-assisted behavior. These tests are lightweight and run quickly, making them ideal for rapid development and experimentation.


 **Run Plan B tests**:

   ```bash
   pytest -q tests/planb
   ```

## Additional Testing

To run additional tests across the broader app, you can also execute the end-to-end test suite and generate coverage reports.

Run end-to-end tests:
```bash
pytest tests/e2e/ -v
```

Run all tests with coverage:
```bash
pytest tests/ --cov=app -v
```
---

## CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Two workflows now
run in parallel:

1. **ci.yml** ‚Äì  Plan A lint / unit / e2e tests
2. **planb-ci.yml** ‚Äì lightweight Plan B pytest run (`tests/planb`)


Each workflow is triggered only when files relevant to that plan are modified.

The CI steps:
- Builds the application
- Runs linting checks
- Executes unit tests
- Performs end-to-end testing
- Verifies Streamlit startup
